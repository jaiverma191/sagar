Applicability & Examples

According to the definition the singleton pattern should be used when there must be exactly one instance of a class, 
and when it must be accessible to clients from a global access point. Here are some real situations where the singleton is used:

Example 1 - Logger Classes

The Singleton pattern is used in the design of logger classes. This classes are ussualy implemented as a singletons, 
and provides a global logging access point in all the application components without being necessary to create an object each time a 
logging operations is performed.

Example 2 - Configuration Classes

The Singleton pattern is used to design the classes which provides the configuration settings for an application. 
By implementing configuration classes as Singleton not only that we provide a global access point, but we also keep the instance we use 
as a cache object. When the class is instantiated( or when a value is read ) the singleton will keep the values in its internal structure.
If the values are read from the database or from files this avoids the reloading the values each time the configuration parameters are used.

 
Example 3 - Accesing resources in shared mode

It can be used in the design of an application that needs to work with the serial port. Let's say that there are many classes in the 
application, working in an multi-threading environment, which needs to operate actions on the serial port. In this case a singleton with 
synchronized methods could be used to be used to manage all the operations on the serial port.

Example 4 - Factories implemented as Singletons

Let's assume that we design an application with a factory to generate new objects(Acount, Customer, Site, Address objects) with their ids, 
in an multithreading environment. If the factory is instantiated twice in 2 different threads then is possible to have 2 overlapping ids 
for 2 different objects. If we implement the Factory as a singleton we avoid this problem. Combining Abstract Factory or Factory Method 
and Singleton design patterns is a common practice.


Serialization

If the Singleton class implements the java.io.Serializable interface, when a singleton is serialized and then deserialized more 
than once, there will be multiple instances of Singleton created. In order to avoid this the readResolve method should be implemented.
See Serializable () and readResolve Method () in javadocs.

	public class Singleton implements Serializable {
		...

		// This method is called immediately after an object of this class is deserialized.
		// This method returns the singleton instance.
		protected Object readResolve() {
			return getInstance();
		}
	}
	
	
Hot Spot:

    Multithreading - A special care should be taken when singleton has to be used in a multithreading application.
    Serialization - When Singletons are implementing Serializable interface they have to implement readResolve method in order to 
    				avoid having 2 different objects.
    Classloaders - If the Singleton class is loaded by 2 different class loaders we'll have 2 different classes, one for each class loader.
    Global Access Point represented by the class name - The singleton instance is obtained using the class name. At the first view this is 
    													an easy way to access it, but it is not very flexible. If we need to replace the 
    													Sigleton class, all the references in the code should be changed accordinglly.
