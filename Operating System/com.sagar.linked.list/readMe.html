Q1: Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function).

Q2: Add two numbers represented by linked lists.

Q3: Detect and Remove Loop in a Linked List.

Q4: You are given a Double Link List with one pointer of each node pointing to the next node just like in a 
	single link list. The second pointer however CAN point to any node in the list and not just the
	previous node. Now write a program in O(n) time and O(1) space to duplicate this list. That is, write a program which 
	will create a copy of this list.
