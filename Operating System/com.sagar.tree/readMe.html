Q1. Given a Binary Tree, extract all leaves of it in a Doubly Linked List (DLL). 
	Note that the DLL need to be created in-place. Assume that the node structure of DLL and Binary 
	Tree is same, only the meaning of left and right pointers are different. 
	In DLL, left means previous pointer and right means next pointer. 
	
Q2	Given a Binary Tree, return following value for it.
	1) For every level, compute sum of all leaves if there are leaves at this level. Otherwise ignore it.
	2) Return multiplication of all sums.
	
Q3  Given a Binary Tree, check if all leaves are at same level or not.

Q4  Given a binary tree, print boundary nodes of the binary tree Anti-Clockwise starting from the root.

Q5  Given the binary Tree and the two nodes say ‘a’ and ‘b’, determine whether the two nodes are cousins of
	each other or not.Two nodes are cousins of each other if they are at same level and have different parents.
	
Q6 	How to determine if a binary tree is height-balanced?
	An empty tree is height-balanced. A non-empty binary tree T is balanced if:
	1) Left subtree of T is balanced
	2) Right subtree of T is balanced
	3) The difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree is not more than 1. 
	
Q7	Connect nodes at same level using constant extra space.

Q8  Binary tree was given. Return a tree such that each internal node stores sum of all its child nodes. 
	Each leaf node stores zero.

Q9 	Print Nodes in Top View of Binary Tree.

Q10 Print all nodes at distance k from a given node.

Q11 Find the sum of all cousins of a given key in binary tree.

Q12 Find Least Common Ancestor of two nodes in Binary Tree.

Q13 Construct binary tree from given Inorder and Preorder traversals.

Q14 Given a tree with a special property where leaves are represented with 'L' and internal node'I'.Also, assume
	that each node has either 0 or 2 children.Given preorder traversal of this tree,construct the tree.
