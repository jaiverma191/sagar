Q2. Find minimum number of coins that make a given value.
	Given a value V, if we want to make change for V cents, and we have infinite supply of each of 
	C = { C1, C2, .. , Cm} valued coins, what is the minimum number of coins to make the change? 
	
Q3. Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each of 
	S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesn’t matter.
	
Q4. Given two sequences, print the longest subsequence present in both of them.
