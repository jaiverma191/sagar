Q1: Find max index difference j-i such that a[j]>a[i] and j>i.


Q2: Given a matrix ,where each cell represents a value of strength.
	The value could be positive negative or zero. At each cell the strength value is added.
	You have to reach from point (0,0) to point (m-1,n-1) if at any point the strength becomes zero or 
	negative then you cant proceed further.Find the minimum strength required before starting to 
	reach the end of the matrix.
	eg . {{ 1,-3,0},
		  {-2,1,-1}} 
     Ans: 2 ( (2+1+(-2)+1+(-1)=1 path taken )
     
Q3: Find and element in a rotated array.

Q4: Given a sorted array, with some unknown rotation, i.e, the smallest element is shifted circularly.
	Find the smallest element.
	 
Q5:	Write an efficient  program to find the sum of contiguous subarray within 
	a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum. 
	 
Q6:	You are given a matrix of size M x N and only possible values in the matrix are
	0 ? representing empty position
	1 ? representing a fresh apple
	2 ? representing a rotten apple
	A rotten apple converts all the fresh apples to rotten ones which are adjacent to it in 1 unit of time. 
	Given an input the matrix and you have to calculate the amount of time in which all the fresh apples become 
	rotten. Also determine whether all fresh apples could be made rotten in finite time or not.

Q7: Given an array that contains both positive and negative integers, 
	find the product of the maximum product subarray. 
	Expected Time complexity is O(n) and only O(1) extra space can be used.
	
Q8: Write a function rotate(ar[], d, n) that rotates arr[] of size n by d elements.

Q9: Given an unsorted array of n integers which can contain integers from 1 to n. 
	Some elements can be repeated multiple times and some other elements can be absent from the array. 
	Count frequency of all elements that are present and print the missing elements.

Q10:There are 2 sorted arrays A and B of size n each. Write an algorithm to find the median of the array 
	obtained after merging the above 2 arrays(i.e. array of length 2n). The complexity should be O(log(n)).
	
Q11:Given an array with hieghts of rectangles(assuming width is 1), we need to find the largest rectangle possible
	For input: 3,2,5,6,1,4,4 maximum area = 10(from 5 and 6)

Q12:Given a matrix consisting only 0s and 1s, find the maximum size sub-matrix(Not Neccessarily Sequare) with all 1s.

Q13:Given an array of size n and k, how do you find the maximum for every contiguous subarray of size k?
	For example
	arr = 1 5 2 6 3 1 24 7
	k = 3
	ans = 5 6 6 6 24 24
